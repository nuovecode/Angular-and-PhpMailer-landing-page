### Landing Page

This is just a starter kit for landing pages with Angular.js and phpmailer. 
This is not a production-ready template but a set of tools that I love and I think helpful.


#### Installation

I assume you have installed bower and gulp (both are NodeJS applications). Start your local server and clone the repo.
In the root of the project:

* $ npm install
* $ bower install
* $ gulp

Use gulp-watch during development.

#### Adding components

The javascript files should be placed in the src/js folder and inserted inside the task js of your gulpfile.

The sample is extralight and does not ship with all Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript. To add new Bootstrap styles import in the file src / less / style.less preceded by the variable @bootstrap-path.


#### What's in the kit?

* Angular.js
* Angular-Route
* PhpMailer (Here. Very helpful )
* JQuery
* Scaffolding with npm, bower and gulp
* Bootstrap/Less
* A great contact form (This)
